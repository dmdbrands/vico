/**
 * A [CartesianMarkerController] for iOS Health-like marker scrubbing.
 *
 * Gesture behavior (handled by Modifier.kt's DECIDING state machine):
 * - **Tap** (no movement + release): Toggle marker at tapped data point
 * - **Hold [delayMs]ms + drag**: Scrub marker along data points, all scroll locked
 * - **Horizontal swipe**: Chart scrolls normally (no marker)
 * - **Release after scrub**: Marker stays at last position
 * - **Scroll when marker visible**: Marker dismisses (handled by CartesianChartHostImpl)
 *
 * State ownership:
 * - [isScrubbing]: read by Modifier.kt to disable scrollable modifier
 * - markerX (in CartesianChartHostImpl): single source of truth for marker visibility
 * - NO separate markerVisible flag — markerX != null IS the visibility check
 *
 * @param delayMs hold duration before entering scrub mode (default 200ms)
 * @param onMarkerIndexChanged optional callback fired when marker shows/moves/dismisses.
 *   Receives (clickX, allTargetXValues). Return the X value for marker, or null to skip.
 *   If not provided, vico's internal nearest-target logic is used.
 *   Called with (null, emptyList()) on dismiss.
